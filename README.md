FaceRecog is a web application that detects faces in pictures using the Clarifai API
The web client is built using JavaScript with React.js on the front-end and Node.js & Express.js on the back-end (API). PostgreSQL is used for the database. 
The structure of the web application is such that the front-end fetches the required data from the back-end API which manages the pipeline for user registering, login and also makes the API calls to Clarifai.

Note: 
The libraries and dependencies used in the project are not the latest. At the time it was built, some of the newer dependencies were causing errors thus they were deprecated.
